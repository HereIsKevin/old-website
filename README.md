# Hi, I'm Kevin

Welcome to the third version of my website. Unlike the last two versions, this one builds on modern technologies like [Astro](https://astro.build/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) instead of a MacGyver-style mishmash of scripts and templates.

## Used Technologies

This website relies on quite a bit of open-source technology, more than Astro and TypeScript. PostCSS, Prettier, ESLint, and Stylelint are only a few. For example, this [Voronoi Editor](https://voronoi-editor.web.app/) generated the some of the page backgrounds, while closed-source tools like [Visiwig](https://www.visiwig.com/) generated the rest.
