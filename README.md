# Hi, I'm Kevin

Welcome to the third version of my website. Unlike the last two versions, this one builds on modern technologies like [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) instead of a MacGyver-style mishmash of scripts and templates.

## A Brief History

The original version of this website began taking shape around June 2019. After a brief burst of development, stagnation continued for a significant period. The classical "Lorem ipsum" placeholder text covered the front page while planned design changes went unimplemented.

The website was hand-written with absolutely no templating involved. Packages used, like [minimal.css](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/minimal.css), were copy-and-pasted into the repository.

Later, as development restarted around March 2021, significant restructuring was needed to make the website workable again. Instead of making changes to the existing code, I threw all of it away. A new patchwork of [Jinja](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) templates compiled by Python scripts formed the basis of the website.

Similar to last time, development quickly stagnated again. By August 2022, I was itching to improve the content and theme because it was cringy and visually bland.

However, this time, I procrastinated on making changes until nearly a year later, on June 2023. Thus ends my journey in the development of my website. Or at least for now.

## Used Technologies

This website relies on quite a bit of open-source technology, more than Astro and TypeScript. PostCSS, Prettier, ESLint, and Stylelint are only a few. For example, this [Voronoi Editor](https://voronoi-editor.web.app/) generated the some of the page backgrounds, while closed-source tools like [Visiwig](https://www.visiwig.com/) generated the rest.
