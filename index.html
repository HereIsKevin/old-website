              I am the creator, designer, and team leader for truth, a
              revolutionary solution for combating misinformation. After
              envisioning and setting up the groundwork for truth, I began the
              project in November 2020 and entered it into the

                >2020 Samsung Solve for Tomorrow Competition</a

              United States, my project was one of the 75 entries that reached
              the semi-finals. My project was featured on the

              A revolutionary ML-based solution to combat misinformation.
              Powered by TensorFlow and spaCy, Convoluta is built upon cutting
              edge technologies. Convoluta is set to launch around late 2021,

              A lightweight and blazing-fast web components library built upon a

              resulting in near zero-cost rendering. boreDOM is comparable to
              lit-html in performance and crushes React and Angular.

              Fun and simple, GeoBounce is a platformer game built by Boredom

              performance and the enjoyment of the player. Each level is a
              combination of challenges, fun, and much more, each more rewarding
              than the last.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Hi, I'm Kevin, as you already know. I'm currently a aspiring
              developer, student, and future CEO (hopefully). Coding is my
              passion and I seek to create pieces of software to improve the
              lives of others, whether they are developers like me or just
              ordinary people. In my spare time, I play the violin (though I
              need to practice more), read books (voraciously), and learn (both
              at school and elsewhere).

            <h3>What I Know and What I'm Learning</h3>
            <p>
              Currently, I know Python and Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
              programming well. I enjoy using TypeScript and Sass when creating
              frontends and Python or Node.js when creating backends. I know
              Shell, C# and Tcl/Tk relatively well. Currently, I'm learning
              Rust, Go, and the C family of languages (C, C++, Objective-C).

            <p>
              Please star my projects on GitHub if you find them inspiring,
              helpful, or interesting so I can know they are appreciated. My
              current project is Convoluta, which I hope to release around late
              2021.
