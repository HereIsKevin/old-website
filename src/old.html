        <p>
          I am the creator, designer, and team leader for truth, a revolutionary
          solution for combating misinformation. After envisioning and setting
          up the groundwork for truth, I began the project in November 2020 and
          entered it into the

            >2020 Samsung Solve for Tomorrow Competition</a
          >. Out of the thousands of entries submitted from all over the United
          States, my project was one of the 75 entries that reached the
          semi-finals. My project was featured on the

        </h3>
        <p>
          A simple, lightweight and blazing-fast UI library built upon a simple
          and highly optimized rendering system. By only diffing dynamic fields,
          Fluid does not need to diff the whole DOM tree, resulting in near
          zero-cost rendering. Fluid is faster than hyperHTML and lit-html in
          performance and crushes React and Angular.

          A revolutionary ML-based solution to combat misinformation. Powered by
          TensorFlow and spaCy, Convoluta is built upon cutting edge
          technologies. Convoluta is set to launch around late 2021, with the

          <b><i>neat</i></b> is extremely extensible, with a simple API for

        <p>
          Fun and simple, GeoBounce is a platformer game built by Boredom Games
          and is much like Geometry Dash and Boxel Rebound. With a custom-built
          game engine, GeoBounce sacrifices nothing for performance and the
          enjoyment of the player. Each level is a combination of challenges,
          fun, and much more, each more rewarding than the last.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Kevin, as you already know. I'm currently a aspiring
          developer, student, and future CEO (hopefully). Coding is my passion
          and I seek to create pieces of software to improve the lives of
          others, whether they are developers like me or just ordinary people.
          In my spare time, I play the violin (though I need to practice more),
          read books (voraciously), and learn (both at school and elsewhere).
        </p>

      <div class="tile">
        <h3>What I Know and What I'm Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, I know Python and Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) programming
          well. I enjoy using TypeScript and Sass when creating frontends and
          Python or Node.js when creating backends. I know Shell, C# and Tcl/Tk
          relatively well. Currently, I'm learning Rust, Go, and the C family of
          languages (C, C++, Objective-C).

        <h3>A Side Note</h3>
        <p>
          Please star my projects on GitHub if you find them inspiring, helpful,
          or interesting so I can know they are appreciated. My current project
          is Convoluta, which I hope to release around late 2021.
