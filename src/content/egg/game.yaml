    heading: Welcome to Useless
    message: >-
      Useless, as its name states, is a very boring and very stupid game of
      "adventure," "exploration," and (not) much more. All state is not
      automatically stored, and you will (obviously) not have a name. Each room
      contains this obnoxious, ugly, and slow message, and please input what is
      in the "[" and "]" when you see prompt like ">" or something similar. To
      exit, just reload this page or whatever you use on your computer to
      terminate an useless program. First stop, the strange laboratory.
    action: laboratory
  laboratory:
    heading: The Strange Laboratory
    message: >-
      You are now in a very strange room. Piles of trash surround you, while
      some sort of strange slug oozes along beside you. Do you wish to [touch]
      the slug, or just [move] along to the next room?
    actions:
      touch: slug
      move: warehouse
  slug:
    heading: The Slug
    message: >-
      The slug sprays some sort of acid or poison at you. As it returns back to
      its old, seemingly harmless state, your hand slowly dissolves away. Your
      vision dims, and you feel your life ebbing away from you.
    action: end
  warehouse:
    heading: The Warehouse
    message: >-
      For some reason, there is a large warehouse right next to the laboratory.
      As you begin to explore your surroundings, a very large cargo container
      drops out of nowhere and nearly crushes you to death. Do you wish to
      attempt to [open] the container, or just [move] on?
    actions:
      open: container
      move: jungle
  container:
    heading: Inside the Container
    message: >-
      Inside the container, you find there is nothing but junk. Do you wish to
      [search] the junk, or just [move] back to the warehouse?
    actions:
      search: search
      move: warehouse
  search:
    heading: Searching the Container
    message: >-
      As you search the piles of junk in the container, you find nothing other
      than junk (duh). Just as you are about to give, you hear a slight rustling
      noise. Do you want to [search] for the source of the noise or just [move]
      back to the warehouse?
    actions:
      search: noise
      move: warehouse
  noise:
    heading: Searching for Noise
    message: >-
      As you search for the source of the noise, you find no sign of what made
      the noise. Suddenly, some sort of strange, black creature jumps up behind
      you and crushes your head. As your brain oozes out around you, everything
      grows dim and you die.
    action: end
  jungle:
    heading: The Jungle
    message: >-
      When you exit the warehouse, you feel a blast of hot air. The air is
      stifling and humid. Around you are tall trees covered in vines, hanging
      ominously over you. A small dark trail stretches to the east, while a
      well-worn path to a clearing faces the west. The jungle is silent, with no
      sign of animals or insects around. Do you wish to follow the small
      [trail], go to the [clearing], or [investigate] the lack of wildlife?
    actions:
      trail: trail
      clearing: clearing
      investigate: investigate
  trail:
    heading: The Trail
    message: >-
      Hiking on the small, well-worn trail, you notice some strange-looking
      plants off to the left, some with bulbous green heads spotted with vivid
      red splotches. As you look around, you notice some large footprints off
      the right, possibly created by some unknown creature. Do you want to
      [investigate] to strange plants, [follow] the footprints, or [continue] on
      the trail.
    actions:
      investigate: plants
      follow: footprints
      continue: trapdoor
  plants:
    heading: Investigating the Plants
    message: >-
      You investigate the plants, poking them with a stick, sniffing their
      strange odor, and watching the bulbous head pulsate. As you poke the heads
      harder and harder with a stick, one explodes, spraying you with some sort
      of strange substance. As your hands shrivel up before your eyes, crumbling
      off into dust, your body disintegrates and you die.
    action: end
  footprints:
    heading: Following the Footprints
    message: >-
      As you follow the footprints, a strange sense of foreboding grows upon
      you, making you regret taking this path. You notice a shadow behind you,
      and wonder what it is. Do you want to [investigate] the shadow or go back
      to the [trail]?
    actions:
      investigate: investigate
      trail: trail
  clearing:
    heading: The Clearing
    message: >-
      You enter the clearing, but find nothing of interest. As you are about to
      leave, you notice a strange shadow behind you. Do you want to
      [investigate] the strange shadow or go [back]?
    actions:
      investigate: investigate
      back: jungle
  investigate:
    heading: Investigating the Strangeness
    message: >-
      As you attempt to investigate, a dark blur of fury pounces upon you,
      ripping and shredding you. Lying mortally wounded on the ground, you that
      mysterious, unknown entity was most likely the reason the jungle is
      lacking in wildlife.
    action: end
  trapdoor:
    heading: The Tiny Trapdoor
    message: >-
      The trail ends abruptly after a few miles. At first, you see nothing but a
      the vegetation of the dense jungle around you, with no sign of any animals
      or footprints. However, after some more observation, you notice the
      outline of a small square on the ground. Brushing the soil away with your
      hands, you uncover a trapdoor, which you slide open with some effort. Do
      you want to [enter] the trapdoor or [force] your way through the jungle?
    actions:
      enter: slope
      force: stalker
  slope:
    heading: The Slippery Slope
    message: >-
      As instant you slide into the trapdoor, your feet hit a slippery slope.
      You struggle for a moment, attempting to hold on the the rim of the
      trapdoor, but then you fall onto the slope. Immediately, you begin to
      slide down the slippery stone slope. As everything flashes past you, you
      occasionally see some roots from trees that have penetrated the stone from
      above. Do you attempt to [hold] on to a root or [continue] sliding?
    actions:
      hold: hold
      continue: entrance
  stalker:
    heading: The Stalker
    message: You die.
    action: end
  hold:
    heading: Holding On
    message: >-
      You attempt to hold on the the tree root, but you slip and continue to
      slide down the slope.
    action: entrance
  entrance:
    heading: The Forgotten Temple
    message: >-
      As you slowly slide to a stop, you see a large, mysterious temple before
      you. Illuminated by a soft green glow, you see that the temple's facade is
      the likeness of some sort of evil creature. Just as you are about to enter
      the temple's dark interior, you hear a roar of fury coming from far away,
      echoing off the walls. Do you attempt to [enter] the temple or [escape]
      from this evil place? (to be continued).
    action: end
