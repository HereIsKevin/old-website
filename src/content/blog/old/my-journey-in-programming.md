Nearly three years ago, I began my journey in programming. At first, I was unable to do much, except following tutorials while I attempted to learn Python and Web Development. After a few months, I created my first project, [Simplelight](https://simplelight.github.io/), a simple and lightweight CSS framework.

On the other hand, I was not as successful with learning Python, as my first project in Python, ExploreQuest, was a total failure. Slowly, with each new failure, my skills blossomed and my knowledge grew as I swallowed up techniques, articles, and much more. My next successful major project was [minimal.css](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/minimal.css), another lightweight CSS framework that I still use for the [Horner Coding Club](https://hornercodingclub.github.io/) website.

Before I started my next project, I dabbled with shell script, creating [spacemacs-app](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/spacemacs-app), prebuilt binaries for Spacemacs for macOS.

The next successful project that I created with Python was [GeoBounce](https://github.com/boredomgames/GeoBounce), a platformer game similar to Geometry Dash or Boxel Rebound.

After GeoBounce came [neat](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/neat), then [boreDOM](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/boreDOM), and many more projects of varying degrees of success.

My current projects range from .io games to compilers, all with varying degrees of success, with the foremost being my current major project [Convoluta](https://convoluta.github.io/), a revolutionary solution for detecting misinformation through machine learning.

In my journey in programming, I find that failure is the key to success. "Failure is the key to success" may be a commonly repeated and scorned-upon phrase, but it truly applies to programming. Programming is a journey of learning from failure. No matter how long one has learned programming, failure is still imminent, appearing at every turn.

Many fail early on in their journey in programming, and I nearly did many times. I have created at least five web frameworks, all failures, some before boreDOM, some after. I have created at least four GUI toolkits, some in Python, some in C and C++, some in Rust, and none of them work. I have created six text editors, some for the web, some for the terminal, and some with GUIs, and none of them work. I have created seven interpreters and compilers for many varying purposes, and none of them work except for [SharpLox](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/SharpLox), my implementation of Lox in C#, which is dead slow.

My journey in programming is fraught with failure, but I still cherish programming. Before I end this article, I want to leave the reader with one final message. **Failure is the key to success.** Yes, that is my message to the reader. On short phrase that everyone knows, yet does not take to heart as they should.
