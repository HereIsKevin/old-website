The original version of this website began taking shape around June 2019. After a brief burst of development, stagnation continued for a significant period. The classical "Lorem ipsum" placeholder text covered the front page while planned design changes went unimplemented.

The website was hand-written with absolutely no templating involved. Packages used, like [minimal.css](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/minimal.css), were copy-and-pasted into the repository.

Later, as development restarted around March 2021, significant restructuring was needed to make the website workable again. Instead of making changes to the existing code, I threw all of it away. A new patchwork of [Jinja](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) templates compiled by Python scripts formed the basis of the website.

Similar to last time, development quickly stagnated again. By August 2022, I was itching to improve the content and theme because it was cringy and visually bland.

However, this time, I procrastinated on making changes until nearly a year later, on June 2023. Thus ends my journey in the development of my website. Or at least for nowâ€”I still have to refactor the spaghetti code.
